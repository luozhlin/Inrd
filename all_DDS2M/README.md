## Installation
Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:miaoyuchun/DDS2M.git
```

The project was developed using Python 3.7.10, and torch 1.12.1.
You can build the environment via pip as follow:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments
We provide code to reproduce the main results on HSI completion, HSI denoising, and HSI super-resolution as follows:
```
python main_completion.py
python main_denoising.py
python main_sisr.py
```
